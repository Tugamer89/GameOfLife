# Game Of Life

This is a C++ implementation of the Game of Life, a cellular automaton invented by mathematician John Horton Conway. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have a Windows operating system and Visual Studio installed on your machine.

### Installing

You can download the source code of the project from the GitHub repository. Once you have the files, you can open the solution in Visual Studio and build the project.

### Running the Game

Once the project is built and the executable is generated, you can run the game by executing the file in the command prompt.
